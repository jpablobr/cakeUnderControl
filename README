This patch allowed one to run Cakephp unit tests from inside PHPUnderControl. 

The patch is meant for Cakephp 1.2 and above... it will allow you to run SimpleTest inside PHPUnderControl. 

SimpleTest is the name of a PHP unit testing framework written by Marcus Baker 
and hosted at simpletest.sourceforge.net (and also at simpletest.org). 

PHPUnderControl can display report from PHPCodeSniffer which is a coding convention monitor. 
So how do we use the patch for Cakephp Here are the steps :

[I am assuming that we are doing everything inside the Unix home directory "testenv" whose absolute path is "/home/testenv". 
You are; of course, free to use a different path.]

0. Download and uncompress CruiseControl. I am assuming CruiseControl now resides at "/home/testenv/cc".
1. Install PHPUnderControl.

2. Copy the patch into the "/home/testenv/cc/webapps/cruisecontrol/" directory.

3. Create these three directories:
"/home/testenv/cc/projects/PROJECT_NAME/build", 
"/home/testenv/cc/projects/PROJECT_NAME/build/logs" and 
""/home/testenv/cc/projects/PROJECT_NAME/build/src-doc". 
Don't forget to replace "PROJECT_NAME" with the actual name of the project.

4. Checkout a copy of your Cakephp project into "/home/testenv/cc/projects/PROJECT_NAME/source" 
and then install the Cakephp instance. A good alternative is to create a symbolic link to an existing Cakephp installation.

5. Once Cakephp is installed (or symlinked), make sure that the SimpleTest module is enabled.

6. Now include the Cakephp project in CruiseControl's main configuration file (i.e. config.xml). 

7. The last step is to create the build file (build.xml, the famous Ant build file) for the project. 
This build file will decide what will happen everytime any new code is committed into the version control system. 

Next browse to "http://localhost:8080/cruisecontrol/index". The Cakephp project should be listed.
